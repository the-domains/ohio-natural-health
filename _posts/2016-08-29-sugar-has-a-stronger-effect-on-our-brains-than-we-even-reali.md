  German scientists have discovered that our brains are actively taking in sugar
  from the blood stream, overturning the long-held assumption that this was a
  purely passive process. Even more surprising, they also found that it's not
  our neurons that are responsible for absorbing all that sugar - it's our glial
  cells, which make up 90 percent of the brain's total cells, and until very
  recently, have been shrouded in mystery.
